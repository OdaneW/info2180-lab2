                <h2>How a Note 4 Runs in 2021</h2>
                <p>October 1, 2021 by Odane Williams</p>
                <img src="note4.jpg" alt="Odane's Note 4">
                <p1>The Samsung Galaxy Note 4 is a 7-year-old phone that made its debut in September 2014. It was a powerhouse at its time of release and, by the standards of smartphones in 2014, was one of the top competitors. 
                    Now, how does it fair 7 years later? Well, I must say it gets the job done, but often you may want to get experimental, like seeing how long it would last in a blender or how far it can be thrown. 
                    It is useful for browsing, texting, watching YouTube videos, and very light gaming but don’t think for one moment that anything will be accessed smoothly. 
                    For example, if you press home while in a WhatsApp chat and try to reopen the app, best believe that you will wait at least 20 seconds before anything responds.
                    Now this may seem trivial but start a stopwatch and watch the seconds until it reaches 20 to get an idea.
                    <br><br> 
                    By today's standards the Note 4's performance is mediocre at best, but it will get you through your day. It still takes decent photos and there is the S-pen for convenience. 
                    It also still has features that still aren't in many phones to date like the IR Blaster at the top and the heartrate monitor. 
                    Also, in a time where the headphone jacks are starting to be removed from smartphones, it being present is now a bonus. 
                    I can say that the Note 4 may not be suitable in this time but, with patience, is quite usable.</p1>

                <h2>Why I Play Warframe</h2>
                <p>October 1, 2021 by Odane Williams</p>
                <img id="image2" src="warframe.jpeg" alt="Warframe Image">
                <p1>Warframe is a free to play multiplayer online game where there seems to be no limits on configurations for various equipment that can be earned in game. 
                    It is mostly co-op, and you can choose whether to go as a single player or to play with anyone whether it's random persons or with friends. 
                    With a multitude of arsenal to choose from ranging from knives, Gun-Blades, bows, swords, great swords, rifles, 
                    grenade launchers, fans, bo staffs, shotguns, shotgun cannons, flamethrowers, and many more I’ve yet to collect. 
                    Each having their own set of upgrade configurations to suit your playstyle. There are also a wide range of mission types, the main ones being defence, exterminate, assassination, rescue, capture, spy, defection, and disruption. 
                    Whether you’re on a planet or in outer space, these are the main types of missions you will be doing.
                    <br><br>
                    There are several Warframes to choose from where a new one is introduced every few months most of which, seemingly, has some overpowered ability. 
                    My favourite, mostly based on cool factor, being Mesa’s 4th ability, Peacemaker, where she draws her dual pistols and when you hold fire, she headshots everything on sight with a different pose for each shot. 
                    The longer you hold the faster she shoots and the higher the damage making it one of the best crowd control abilities in the game. 
                    To get into all the reasons I play this game would need several pages and so I’ve only touched on the very basic parts. 
                    I can say I will be playing for years to come, maybe not everyday but it will always be in my list of favourites.
